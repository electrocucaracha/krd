***********************************************
Benchmark results of Kubernetes network plugins
***********************************************

This document collects the results obtained from the execution of the
`kubernetes-iperf3 tool <https://github.com/Pharb/kubernetes-iperf3>`_
which measures the network bandwidth used by all nodes of a minimal
Kubernetes setup. 

Kubernetes setup
################

The Linux distro used for all nodes is  *Ubuntu Focal*. Hardware resources were
distributed in the following manner: 

+------------------+-------+--------+
| Hostname         | vCPUs | Memory |
+==================+=======+========+
| controller       | 2     | 4 GB   |
+------------------+-------+--------+
| worker01         | 2     | 8 GB   |
+------------------+-------+--------+

**Software versions**

+--------------+--------------------+
| Name         | Version            |
+==============+====================+
| Ubuntu       | Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS |
+--------------+--------------------+
| Kernel       | 5.4.0-70-generic   |
+--------------+--------------------+
| Kubernetes   | v1.19.9            |
+--------------+--------------------+
| Flannel      | v0.13.0            |
+--------------+--------------------+
| Calico       | v3.16.9            |
+--------------+--------------------+

This setup can be achieved creating the following  *config/pdf.yml* file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: controller
      os:
        name: ubuntu
        release: focal
      networks:
        - name: public-net
          ip: "10.10.16.3"
      memory: 4096
      cpus: 2
      volumes:
        - name: sdb
          size: 25
          mount: /var/lib/docker/
      roles:
        - kube-master
        - etcd
    - name: worker01
      os:
        name: ubuntu
        release: focal
      networks:
        - name: public-net
          ip: "10.10.16.4"
      memory: 8192
      cpus: 2
      volumes:
        - name: sdb
          size: 25
          mount: /var/lib/docker/
      roles:
        - kube-node

Once the Kubernetes cluster is provisioned by vagrant is possible to execute
the networking benchmark process. A new iperf log file will be created on the
user's home folder.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./krd_command.sh -a run_internal_k6

In order to get other results is necessary to reprovision the cluster with
the desired CNI.

.. code-block:: bash

    for KRD_NETWORK_PLUGIN in calico cilium flannel; do
        export KRD_NETWORK_PLUGIN
        ./krd_command.sh -a uninstall_k8s -a install_k8s -a run_internal_k6
    done

Results
#######

+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Measurement | Flannel        | Calico         | Cilium         |
+=============+================+================+================+
| Bitrate     | 5.18 Gbits/sec | 5.09 Gbits/sec | 4.37 Gbits/sec |
+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Transfer    | 6.03 GBytes    | 5.68 GBytes    | 5.09 GBytes    |
+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

This execution uses **kube-proxy** configured with *iptables* mode which
allows flexible sequences of rules to be attached to various hooks in the
kernelâ€™s packet processing pipeline but in counterpart the number of rules can
grow roughly in proportion to the cluster size.

.. note::
   EAST-WEST traffic goes from *worker01* to *controller*
