***********************
Bare-Metal Provisioning
***********************

The Kubernetes Reference Deployment (KRD) is designed to run on both
Virtual Machines and Bare-Metal servers. The *aio.sh* script contains
the bash instructions needed to provision an All-in-One Kubernetes
cluster on a Bare-Metal server. This document outlines the required
hardware and software, and explains the key phases of *aio.sh*.

aio.sh
######

The *aio.sh* script automates the process of deploying an All-in-One
Kubernetes cluster.

To start the provisioning process, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -fsSL http://bit.ly/KRDaio | KRD_ACTIONS_LIST="install_k8s,install_cockpit" bash

The script performs the following phases:

1. Server validation
2. Dependency installation
3. Configuration
4. Deployment of KRD services

**Server validation**

The script first checks that the user account running KRD has
passwordless sudo privileges and that the serverâ€™s IP address is
included in the NO_PROXY environment variable.

**Installation of dependencies**

KRD requires the `git` command-line tool to fetch its source code.
It also executes *node.sh*, which installs additional management
tools required for the deployment.

**Configuration**

Ansible uses an inventory file to define the systems it will manage.
For an All-in-One deployment, the *aio.sh* script creates a local
inventory file that points Ansible tasks to `localhost`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat <<EOL > inventory/hosts.ini
    [all]
    localhost

    [kube_control_plane]
    localhost

    [kube_node]
    localhost

    [etcd]
    localhost

    [k8s-cluster:children]
    kube_node
    kube_control_plane
    EOL

Since Ansible uses SSH for executing tasks, the following instructions
generate and register SSH keys to enable passwordless authentication:

.. code-block:: bash

    # echo -e "\n\n\n" | ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ""
    # cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    # chmod og-wx ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

**Deploying KRD services**

Once configuration is complete, the KRD provisioning process can be
started by running the *krd_command.sh* script. Logs are saved to
*krd_${krd_action}.log* for future reference.

.. code-block:: bash

    # ./krd_command.sh -a "$krd_action" | tee "krd_${krd_action}.log"

.. image:: ./img/installer_workflow.png
